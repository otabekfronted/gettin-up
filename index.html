                        <p>
                            This Figma Design makes heavy use of powerful Figma
                            features, including components and Auto Layout.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If youâ€™re new to Figma, getting some basic knowledge
                            about these features will greatly help you create
                            landing pages with this kit. We also recommend
                            checking Figma's Help Center for the best tutorials
                            on more advanced features, such as
                            <a href="#"> components </a>, and
                            <a href="#"> Auto Layout.</a>

                        <p>
                            This UI kit is designed to work with the Figma to
                            Shopify with Instant Plugin. With this plugin you
                            can send your Figma designs to Shopify in no-time.
                            To get a better understanding how this works, please
                            watch our Figma to Shopify Tutorial.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our recommended workflow is to get familiar with the
                            structure of the sections used in the kit. Change
                            the components to your own branding and content,
                            then publish to Shopify via Instant. Any updates you
                            make here inside Figma require a new copy + paste
                            action.
